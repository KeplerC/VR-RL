I will take care about the experiment. Currently I was using
mssn6.cse.ohio-state.edu as the udp saturater server. If you also want to ran
saturation exp, you may need to use another server to avoid possible
bottleneck. You can find the udp saturater tools under
mssnOwnCloud/Datahint/tool/.

    For the server side, there are Program_15001 and Program_9998 which are
already compiled and they use port 15001 and 9998 accordingly. If you want to
use other port, you may need to modify line 18 in source/main.c. To compile it
just run:

        make clean
        make

    Don't forget to check if the port used is allowed for udp traffic.

    To start the server side, just execute the Program file: ./Program

    For the client side, I am not sure if I had installed the udp saturater on
your Nexus 6P. It not, you may need to copy the Program_udpSaturater into
/system/bin/ and give it the permission for execution:

        cd owncloud/mssn/Datahint/tool/udpSaturater/client
        adb push Program_udpSaturater /sdcard/
        adb shell
        cd /sdcard/
        su
        mount -o remount,rw /system
	# for Nexus 6P, run $ mount -o rw,remount /system
        mv Program_udpSaturater /system/bin/
        chmod a+x /system/bin/Program_udpSaturater

    To run the client program (no need root privilege):

        Usage: Program_udpSaturater <Server IP> <Server Port> <TotalPkt>
<PktSize> <Interval> <Heart beat interval>

        Both interval unit is microsecond (1e-6 second), we can use <Interval>
to control the throughput upper bound, and I usually set <Heart beat interval>
to 1000000 (every 1 second). The PktSize unit is byte.
